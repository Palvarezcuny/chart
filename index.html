        <p>
          The contributions of immigrants to the US labor force and economy have been well-documented. The labor force participation rates of the foreign-born, have long exceeded those of the native-born (BLS 2019).

      The number of foreign-born essential workers is pretty high on its own, but it gets more complex when we take into account that 70% of undocumented workers, are also essential workers. Although is hard to get specific data regarding this relationship, there is a direct relation between these two groups, many of them may even be part of the same family.

        </script>
      <p>Undocumented essential workers don’t receive help from the government in NYC, so if they are ordered to quarantine, they wouldn’t be able to support their families. The result is that immigrants (documented or undocumented) working as essential workers will be less willing to give the contact information of his/her undocumented friends or family.
